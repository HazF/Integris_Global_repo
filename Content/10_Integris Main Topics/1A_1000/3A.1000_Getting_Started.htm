        <h1 style="mc-auto-number-format: '{chapnum}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1. ">Integris 1000 Getting Started</h1>
        <p>This <MadCap:conditionalText>section</MadCap:conditionalText> <MadCap:conditionalText>chapter </MadCap:conditionalText>explains how to connect the Integris 3000 System to the network. The location and use of the connections are described along with details of how to turn on and use the system.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.1. ">Unpacking the System</h2>
        <p>The System packaging should be opened with care. If you need to return the system in the future it would be preferable that the original packaging was reused.</p>
        <p>1 Remove the box containing the User Guide and additional items.</p>
        <p>2 Remove the foam and packaging surrounding the System</p>
        <p>3 Remove the System and place it on a flat surface with sufficient room for it to not fall off while it is running</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.2. ">Connecting and Powering On the System</h2>
        <p>The external power supply for the Integris Chassis is located in the transport case and connects to the front of the Integris case.</p>
        <p>The Integris 3000 Platform operates from a single-phase power source with the neutral conductor at or near earth ground. The line conductor is fused for over-current protection. A protective ground connection is essential for safe operation.</p>
        <p><b>Important</b> Before plugging the power supply into a power source ensure your power source is compliant with the power supply requirements detailed on the power supply. The unit requires power input voltages between 90 and 240V AC with a frequency of 50Hz or 60Hz. The power source should be capable of supplying a current of at least 5A.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Plug the external power supply 110V/220V input to a power source and the low voltage connector to the Integris chassis</li>
            <li>Switch the Integris unit on</li>
            <li>The Power LED will light. After a short period the Status LED will glow green once the unit initialization has completed successfully</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.3. ">Cabling the system for real-time RF extraction off a CPRI link</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The SFP Test Port is located on the side of the Integris 3000 case towards the front. Insert the correct wavelength SFPs into the test port</li>
            <p><b>Note:</b> you MUST install the exact same SFP’s into Integris as used in RRH &amp; BBU</p>
            <li>Lock down the sector to be tested</li>
            <li>Determine the correct CPRI link</li>
            <li>Make sure the signal source is set to LIVE (Integris System Menu, Source menu item)</li>
            <li>Connect the Integris 3000 unit between the RRH and BBU. Insert a passive tap between the RRH and BBU, then connect the tap port to the Integris 3000 test port Connection Using a Tap</li>
            <li>Bring the sector back up.</li>
        </ol>
