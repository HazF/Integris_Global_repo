        <p><i>Integris Expert</i> is part of the Integris suite of Radio Access Network (RAN) test tools that provides you with the ability to extract data from a duplex CPRI link.</p>
        <p>CPRI&#160;link traffic consists of three data "Channels"</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I/Q Data that carries the various voice streams between radio heads and the Base Band Unit or Units (BBU)</li>
            <li>Two Command &amp; Management channels, called the Fast C&amp;M&#160;channel and the Slow C&amp;M Channel. These are embedded Ethernet streams used for passing command information between radio heads and the base station.</li>
            <li>In-band signalling for passing link status and requests between network nodes</li>
        </ol>
        <p><i>Integris Expert</i> has two main functions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Extract Fast or Slow Command and Management (Fast or Slow C&amp;M) channel data, and send it live to a previously installed Wireshark application. <i>Wireshark</i> is a cross-platform open-source packet analyzer issued under the terms of the GNU General Public License. It  is widely used for network analysis and communications protocol development, and comes pre-installed on your Integris system. </li>
            <li>Save raw CPRI frame data to an external file. This data is saved in binary form, but converted to Text format when first opened in <i>Integris Expert.</i></li>
        </ol>
        <p>In addition to the above, <i>Integris Expert</i> also monitors the link status and provides SFP Vital Product Data (VPD) and metrics.</p>
