        <h2 class="AA_Online_H2" MadCap:conditions="Default.Screen">General Operating Guidelines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not expose your skin to the computer when operating it in a very hot or cold environment.</li>
            <li>Do not place heavy objects on top of the computer as this may damage the display.</li>
            <li>Do not move the computer simply by grasping the display screen.</li>
            <li>The screen surface is easily scratched. Avoid touching it with a sharp object such as a pen or pencil.</li>
            <li>LCD image sticking occurs when a fixed pattern is displayed on the screen for a prolonged period of time.

            <li>To maximize the life of the backlight in the display, allow the backlight to automatically turn off as a result of power management.</li>
