        <p>This section provides information about the use of the Integris system. If you are new to computers, reading this chapter will help you learn the operating basics. If you are already a computer user, you may choose to read only the parts containing information unique to your computer. </p>
        <p><b>CAUTION</b>: The computer can get uncomfortably warm when you use it in high temperatures. As a safety precaution in such a circumstance, do not place the computer on your lap or touch it with your bare hands for extended periods of time. Prolonged body contact can cause discomfort and potentially a burn.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.2. ">Hot Keys</h2>
        <p><i>Hot keys</i> refer to a combination of keys that can be pressed any time to activate special functions of the computer. Most hot keys operate in a cyclic way. Each time a hot key combination is pressed, it shifts the corresponding function to the other or next choice.</p>
        <p>You can easily identify the hot keys with the icons imprinted on the keytop.</p>

        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.3. ">Using the Touchpad</h2>
        <p><b>CAUTION</b>: Do not use a sharp object such as a pen on the touchpad. Doing so may damage the touchpad surface.</p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: For optimal performance of the touchpad, keep your fingers and the pads clean and dry. When tapping on the pad, tap lightly. Do not use excessive force.</p>
        <p>The touchpad is a pointing device that allows you to communicate with the computer by controlling the location of the pointer on the screen and making selection with the buttons.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/2000/GETAK_Pointing_Dvc.png" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { height: auto;width: 300px; }" />
        </p>
        <p>The touchpad consists of a rectangular pad (work surface) and a left and right buttons. To use the touchpad, place your forefinger or thumb on the pad. The rectangular pad acts like a miniature duplicate of your display. As you slide your fingertip across the pad, the pointer (also called cursor) on the screen moves accordingly. When your finger reaches the edge of the pad, simply relocate yourself by lifting the finger and placing it on the other side of the pad.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.4. ">Configuring the Touchpad</h2>
        <p>You may want to configure the touchpad to suit your needs. For example, if you are a left-handed user, you can swap the two buttons so that you can use the right button as the left button and vice versa. You can also change the size of the on-screen pointer, the speed of the pointer, and so on. </p>
        <p>To configure the touchpad, go to Control Panel.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.5. ">Using the Touchscreen (Optional)</h2>
        <p><b>CAUTION</b>: Do not use a sharp object such as a ballpoint pen or pencil on the touchscreen. Doing so may damage the touchscreen surface.</p>
        <p>The touchscreen is a touch-sensitive device that allows you to navigate on the screen without using a keyboard, touchpad, or mouse. Use the included stylus to select objects on the screen. The stylus can be stretched for better grip and handling.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.6. ">Using the DVD Drive</h2>

        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.14. ">Power&#160;Management</h2>
        <p>Your computer operates either on external AC power or on internal battery power.</p>
        <p>This section tells you how you can effectively manage power. To maintain optimal battery performance, it is important that you use the battery in the proper way.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.15. ">AC Adapter</h2>
        <p><b>CAUTION</b>: The AC adapter is designed for use with your computer only. Connecting the AC adapter to another device can damage the adapter.</p>
        <p>The AC power cord supplied with your computer is for use in the country where you purchased your computer. If you plan to go overseas with the computer, consult your dealer for the appropriate power cord.</p>
        <p>When you disconnect the AC adapter, disconnect from the electrical outlet first and then from the computer. A reverse procedure may damage the AC adapter or computer.</p>
        <p>When unplugging the connector, always hold the plug head. Never pull on the cord.</p>
        <p>The AC adapter serves as a converter from AC (Alternating Current) to DC (Direct Current) power because your computer runs on DC power, but an electrical outlet usually provides AC power. It also charges the battery pack when connected to AC power.</p>
        <p>The adapter operates  in the range of 100~240 V AC, 50Hz or 60Hz.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.16. ">Charging the Battery Pack</h2>
        <p><b>Note</b>: Charging will not start if the battery’s temperature is below 0 °C (32 °F) or above 40 °C (104 °F); the charging process will stop if the battery’s temperature gets above 60 °C (140 °F). To avoid damaging the battery under this situation, disconnect the AC adapter and wait for the battery to return to room temperature before charging again.</p>
        <p>During charging, do not disconnect the AC adapter before the battery has been fully charged; otherwise you will get a prematurely charged battery.</p>
        <p>To charge the battery pack, connect the AC adapter to the computer and an electrical outlet. The Battery Charge Indicator ( ) on the computer glows amber to indicate that charging is in progress. You are advised to keep the computer power off while the battery is being charged. When the battery is fully charged, the Battery Charge Indicator glows green.</p>
        <p>It takes approximately 4 hours to fully charge the Li-Ion battery pack when the computer is off, and approximately 7 hours to fully charge the battery pack when the computer is on.</p>
        <p><b>CAUTION</b>: After the computer has been fully recharged, do not immediately disconnect and reconnect the AC adapter to charge it again. Doing so may damage the battery.</p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: The battery level may automatically lessen due to the self-discharge process (0.21% per day), even when the battery pack is fully charged (100%). This happens no matter if the battery pack is installed in the computer.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.17. ">Initializing the Battery Pack</h2>
        <p>You need to initialize a new battery pack before using it for the first time or when the actual operating time of a battery pack is much less than expected. Initializing is the process of fully charging, discharging, and then charging. It can take several hours.</p>
        <p>A software tool called “Gauge Reset” is provided for the purpose. Use the G-Manager program and select the Battery tab to find the tool.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.18. ">Checking the Battery Level</h2>
        <p>Note: Any battery level indication is an estimated result. The actual operating time can be different from the estimated time, depending on how you are using the computer.</p>
        <p>The operating time of a fully charged battery pack depends on how you are using the computer. When your applications often access peripherals, you will experience a shorter operating time. You can check the approximate battery level using the battery meter function of the operating system. To read the battery level in Windows, click the battery icon on the taskbar.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.19. ">Checking with a Gas Gauge</h2>
        <p>On the exterior side of the battery pack is a gas gauge for displaying the estimated battery charge. When the battery pack is not installed in the computer and you want to know the battery charge, you can press the switch with a pointed device to see the corresponding value of indicator segment that light green.</p>
        <p>The value of the corresponding green segment indicates the relative percentage of the battery charge. The battery pack is fully discharged when you see no segment glowing green.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.20. ">Battery Low Signals and Actions</h2>
        <p>The battery icon changes appearance to display the current state of the battery.</p>

        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Do not expose your skin to the computer when operating it in a very hot or cold environment.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Do not place heavy objects on top of the computer as this may damage the display.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Do not move the computer simply by grasping the display screen.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">The screen surface is easily scratched. Avoid touching it with a sharp object such as a pen or pencil.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">LCD image sticking occurs when a fixed pattern is displayed on the screen for a prolonged period of time. You can avoid the problem by limiting the amount of static content on the display. It is recommended that you use a screen saver or turn off the display when it is not in use.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">To maximize the life of the backlight in the display, allow the backlight to automatically turn off as a result of power management.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.27. ">Battery Pack Guidelines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Recharge the battery pack when it is nearly discharged. When recharging, make sure that the battery pack is fully charged. Doing so may avoid harm to the battery pack.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">The battery pack is a consumable product and the following conditions will shorten its life:<ul><li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">when frequently charging the battery pack</li><li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">when using, charging, or storing the battery in high temperature condition</li></ul></li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">To avoid hastening the deterioration of the battery pack thereby prolonging its useful life, minimize the number of times you charge it so as not to frequently increase its internal temperature.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Charge the battery pack between 10 °C ~ 30 °C (50 °F ~ 86 °F) temperature range. A higher environment temperature will cause the battery pack’s temperature to rise. Avoid charging the battery pack inside a closed vehicle and in hot weather condition. Also, charging will not start if the battery pack is not within the allowed temperature range.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">It is recommended that you do not charge the battery pack more than once a day.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">It is recommended that you charge the battery pack with the computer’s power off.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">To maintain the battery pack’s operating efficiency, store it in a cool dark place removed from the computer and with 30 % ~ 40 % charge remaining.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Important guidelines when using the battery pack. When installing or removing the battery pack take note of the following:  <ul><li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">avoid installing or removing the battery pack when the computer is in Sleep mode. Abruptly removing the battery pack may cause loss of data or the computer may become unstable.</li><li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">avoid touching the battery pack terminals or damage may occur, thereby causing improper operation to it or the computer.</li></ul></li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">The computer’s input voltage and surrounding temperature will directly affect the battery pack’s charge and discharge time:<ul><li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">charging time will be prolonged when the computer is turned on. To shorten the charging time, it is recommended that you place the computer in Sleep or hibernation mode.</li><li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">a low temperature will prolong the charging time as well as hasten the discharge time.</li></ul></li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">When using battery power in an extremely low temperature environment, you may experience shortened operating time and incorrect battery level reading. This phenomenon comes from the chemical characteristics of batteries. The appropriate operating temperature for the battery is -10 °C ~ 50 °C (14 °F ~ 122 °F).</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Do not leave the battery pack in storage for more than six months without recharging it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.28. ">Touchscreen Guidelines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Use the finger or the included stylus on the display. Using a sharp or metallic object other than your finger or stylus may cause scratches and damage the display, thereby causing errors.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Use a soft cloth to remove dirt on the display. The touchscreen surface has a special protective coating that prevents dirt from sticking to it. Not using a soft cloth may cause damage to the special protective coating on the touchscreen surface.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Turn off the computer power when cleaning the display. Cleaning the display with the power on may cause improper operation.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Do not use excessive force on the display. Avoid placing objects on top of the display as this may cause the glass to break thereby damaging the display.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Using the touchscreen during low temperature (less than 5 degC) may cause a slower response time, this is normal. A normal response time may be restored upon returning to room temperature.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">When there is noticeable discrepancy in the operation of the touchscreen function (wrong location on intended operation or improper display resolution), refer to the Windows online Help for instructions on recalibrating the touchscreen display.</li>
