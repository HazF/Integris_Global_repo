        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.1. ">Operating the System</h2>
        <p>This section provides information about the use of the Integris Field Server unit. </p>
        <p><b>CAUTION</b>: The computer can get uncomfortably warm when you use it in high temperatures. As a safety precaution in such a circumstance, do not place the computer on your lap or touch it with your bare hands for extended periods of time. Prolonged body contact can cause discomfort and potentially a burn.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.2. ">Windows Keys</h2>
        <p>The keyboard has two keys that perform Windows-specific functions:</p>
        <p>The Windows Logo key opens the Start menu and performs software specific functions when used in combination with other keys. The Application key usually has the same effect as a right mouse click.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.3. ">Connecting to the LAN</h2>
        <p>The included 10/100/1000Base-T LAN (Local Area Network) module allows you to connect the Integris Field Server to a network. It supports data transfer rate up to 1000 Mbps.</p>
        <p>To connect the network cable to the LAN module, connect one end of the LAN cable to the RJ-45 connector on the chassis and the other end to a network switch.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.4. ">Connecting an HDMI Monitor</h2>
        <p>In order to operate your system you must connect to an external monitor.</p>
        <p>The Integris Field Server has an HDMI connector (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) which is an audio/video interface that transmits uncompressed digital data and therefore delivers true HD quality.</p>
        <p>1. Turn off the computer.</p>
        <p>2. Depending on the type of your monitor, plug the monitor’s signal cable into Integris’s HDMI connector.</p>
        <p>3. Plug one end of the monitor’s power cord into the power socket on the monitor and the other end to an electrical outlet.</p>
        <p>4. To use the monitor, turn on the monitor before turning on the computer.</p>
        <p>5. The connected device should respond by default. If not, you can switch the display output by pressing the Fn+F9 hot keys. (You can also change the display through Windows Control Panel &gt; Display Settings &gt; Properties.)</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.5. ">Connecting a USB Device</h2>
        <p>Your Integris Field Server has four USB ports. USB 3.0 supports a transfer rate up to 5 Gbit/s and USB 2.0 a transfer rate up to 480 MB/s.</p>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.6. ">When Traveling</h2>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;"> Before traveling with your computer, make a backup of your hard disk data into flash disks or other storage devices. As an added precaution, bring along an extra copy of your important data.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;"> Hand-carry the computer. Do not check it in as luggage.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;"> If you need to leave the computer in the car, put it in the trunk of the car to avoid exposing the computer to excessive heat.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;"> When going through airport security, it is recommended that you send the computer and flash disks through the X-ray machine (the device you set your bags on). Avoid the magnetic detector (the device you walk through) or the magnetic wand (the handheld device used by security personnel).</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;"> If you plan to travel abroad with your computer, consult your dealer for the appropriate AC power cord for use in your country of destination.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="mc-auto-number-format: 'CH:{chapnum}.{n+}. ';" MadCap:autonum="1.7. ">Troubleshooting: Preliminary Checklist</h2>
        <p>Here are helpful hints to follow before you take further actions when you encounter any problem:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Try to isolate which part of the computer is causing the problem.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Make sure that you turn on all peripheral devices before turning on the computer.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">If an external device has a problem, make sure that the cable connections are correct and secure.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Make sure that the configuration information is properly set in the BIOS Setup program.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Make sure that all the device drivers are correctly installed.</li>
            <li style="font-size: 10pt;line-height: 22px;">Make notes of your observations. Are there any messages on the screen? Do any indicators light? Do you hear any beeps? Detailed descriptions are useful to the service personnel when you need to consult one for assistance.</li>
        </ul>
