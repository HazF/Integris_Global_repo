        <h2 class="AA_Online_H2" MadCap:conditions="Default.Screen">Unpacking the System</h2>
        <p>The System packaging should be opened with care. If you need to return the system in the future it would be preferable that the original packaging was reused.</p>
        <p>Remove the system from any protective packaging. </p>
        <p>After unpacking the shipping carton, you should find these standard items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Integris test system</li>
            <li>AC&#160;Adapter</li>
            <li>Power Cord</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Inspect all the items. If any item is damaged or missing, notify Absolute Analysis support immediately.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>For optimal performance, use the computer where the recommended temperature is between 0 °C (32 °F) and 55 °C (131 °F). (Actual operating temperature depends on product specifications.)</li>
            <li>Avoid placing the computer in a location subject to high humidity, extreme temperatures, mechanical vibration, direct sunlight, or heavy dust. Using in extreme environments for long periods can result in product deterioration and a shortened product life.</li>
            <li>Operating in an environment with metallic dust is not allowed.</li>
            <li>Place the computer on a flat and steady surface. Do not stand the computer on its side or store it in an upside-down position. A strong impact by dropping or hitting may damage the computer.</li>
            <li>Do not cover or block any ventilation openings on the computer. For example, do not place the computer on a bed, sofa, rug, or other similar surface. Otherwise, overheating may occur that results in damage to the computer.</li>
            <li>As the computer can become very hot during operation, keep it away from objects that are vulnerable to heat.</li>
            <li>Keep the computer at least 13 cm (5 inches) away from electrical appliances that can generate a strong magnetic field such as a TV, refrigerator, motor, or a large audio speaker.</li>
            <li>Avoid moving the computer abruptly from a cold to a warm place. A temperature difference of more than 10 °C (18 °F) may cause condensation inside the unit, which may damage the storage media.</li>
        </ul>
